## Journey Management

### Understanding Journeys

A **Journey** is a configured sequence of automated actions, decisions, and experiences that guide players through personalized gaming experiences based on their behavior, preferences, and real-time activity.

### Journey Components

#### 1. **Triggers** (Journey Initiation)
Triggers define when and how journeys begin for players.

**Event-Based Triggers:**
- Player registration and first login
- Deposit transactions (amount, frequency, method)
- Gaming activity (game launches, wins, losses)
- Session behavior (login frequency, session duration)

**Time-Based Triggers:**
- Scheduled campaigns (daily, weekly, seasonal)
- Anniversary dates (registration, birthdays)
- Inactivity periods (7 days, 30 days inactive)
- Time-sensitive promotions (weekend specials, holiday events)

**Behavior-Based Triggers:**
- Spending patterns (high rollers, casual players)
- Game preferences (slots, table games, live casino)
- Risk indicators (responsible gaming alerts)
- Engagement metrics (tutorial completion, feature adoption)

#### 2. **Conditions** (Decision Logic)
Conditions evaluate player data to determine journey paths.

**Player Attributes:**
- Demographics: Age, location, registration date
- Account status: VIP level, verification status, account limits
- Preferences: Communication preferences, game favorites
- History: Previous journey participation, bonus redemption

**Gaming Behavior:**
- Financial metrics: Lifetime value, average bet size, deposit frequency
- Game patterns: Favorite games, play times, session duration
- Performance: Win/loss ratios, streaks, volatility preferences
- Engagement: Feature usage, tutorial completion, help requests

**External Data:**
- CRM integration: Customer service interactions, support tickets
- Third-party data: Credit checks, fraud scores, marketing attribution
- Operator-specific: Custom business rules, regulatory requirements

#### 3. **Actions** (Player Experiences)
Actions deliver value and experiences to players.

**Communication Actions:**
- Welcome messages and onboarding sequences
- Promotional offers and campaign announcements
- Educational content (game tutorials, responsible gaming)
- Personalized recommendations and tips

**Bonus Actions:**
- Free spins and bonus credits
- Deposit match bonuses with custom percentages
- Cashback offers based on activity
- Exclusive access to games and tournaments

**Account Actions:**
- VIP tier upgrades and status changes
- Account limit adjustments (with appropriate controls)
- Feature unlocks (advanced games, higher limits)
- Priority support queue assignments

**Content Actions:**
- Personalized game recommendations
- Custom promotional content
- Exclusive tournament invitations
- Early access to new games and features

#### 4. **Flow Control** (Journey Logic)
Flow control manages how players progress through journeys.

**Branching Logic:**
- Conditional paths based on player responses
- Multi-variant testing (A/B/C testing)
- Dynamic content selection
- Fallback paths for edge cases

**Timing Control:**
- Delays between actions (minutes, hours, days)
- Optimal timing based on player behavior
- Time zone adjustments for global operations
- Frequency capping to prevent over-communication

**Exit Conditions:**
- Journey completion criteria
- Early exit triggers (unsubscribe, negative feedback)
- Timeout conditions for inactive paths
- Override conditions for manual interventions

### Journey Configuration Example

## Data Flow & Analytics

### VPB.Next Data Pipeline

Based on the Core Analytics team documentation, VPB.Next generates **substantial data volumes** that require specialized processing:

#### **Data Volume Challenge**
The original VPB.Next data ingestion **crippled the SQL Server instance** due to high volume, requiring a complete rearchitecture of the analytics pipeline.

#### **Current Data Architecture**

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   VPB.Next      │───►│   RabbitMQ       │───►│  Raw SQL        │
